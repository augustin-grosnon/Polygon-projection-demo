# Polygon projection demo

This project is an interactive tool for visualizing the projection of a convex polygon and it's enclosing polygon using a translation vector. The user can define a convex polygon, move it around using the mouse, and observe the results in real-time.

## Features

- **Draw convex polygon**: Interactively create a convex polygon by clicking on the canvas to set points.
- **Translate polygon**: Move the polygon around by dragging it.
- **Real-time updates**: The canvas automatically updates to show the current state of the polygon and its projection.

## Technologies

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the canvas.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the canvas.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the logic for drawing and interacting with the polygon using the Canvas API.

## Project structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the canvas and links to JavaScript files.
- `styles/`: Directory containing CSS files.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing JavaScript files:
  - `Polygon.js`: Defines the `Polygon` class with methods to manage polygon points and transformations.
  - `Drawer.js`: Defines the `Drawer` class for handling user interactions and drawing the polygon on the canvas.
  - `main.js`: Initializes the Drawer and the base Polygon.

## Setup and running the project

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/augustin-grosnon/Polygon-projection-demo.git
   cd Polygon-projection-demo
   ```

2. **Run the project**

   To run the project, you will need to upload the code using a local server. Hereâ€™s how you can do it using Python:

   - **Python 3**

     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```

   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to see the project in action.

## Usage

1. **Drawing the polygon**
   - Click on the canvas to add points and create a convex polygon. The polygon will automatically close when you click near the starting point.

2. **Moving the polygon**
   - Double-click inside the polygon to start dragging. Move the mouse to translate a copy of the polygon around the canvas. Release the mouse button to drop the new polygon to it's new location. (WIP)

3. **Resetting**
   - To start over, you can refresh the page (I might add a button in the future).
